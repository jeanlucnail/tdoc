## [2.1.1] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- **`core/diagnose.sh`**: New `tdoc diagnose` command. Accepts a raw error message as argument or interactively prompts for input. Matches 40+ known error patterns across dpkg, apt, Python, Node.js, Git, storage, and repository issues. After matching, calls `ai_explain` for the identified issue and offers to run a fix immediately.
- **`core/checkup.sh`**: New `tdoc checkup` command. Runs a fresh scan then generates a full shareable health report — device info (brand, model, Android version, ABI), Termux environment, CPU/RAM/storage, installed tool versions, repository sources, scan state, dpkg audit output, and fix history. Supports `--save` (write to `~/.tdoc/checkup_<timestamp>.txt`) and `--json` (machine-readable output).
- **`tdoc watch [interval]`**: Shorthand alias for `tdoc doctor --live [interval]`. Both forms remain supported.
- **`lang/en.sh`** + **`lang/id.sh`**: New language keys for `diagnose` (`L_DIAG_*`) and `checkup` (`L_CHECKUP_*`) commands — fully bilingual EN/ID.
- **`tdoc` help menu**: Updated with `diagnose`, `watch`, `checkup --save`, `checkup --json` entries.

### Fixed
- **`modules/dpkg.sh` — `check_dpkg_lock`**: Previously flagged lock as STALE whether or not a process held it (`locked=true` in both branches). Now correctly: STALE only when file exists **and** no process holds it (`fuser` exits non-zero). Lock held by active dpkg/apt = OK. No lock file = OK.
- **`modules/dpkg.sh` — `check_dpkg_file_conflicts`**: Previous heuristic flagged any package with a `Conflicts:` metadata field as broken — this is normal dpkg metadata present in every package. Now cross-checks each conflict target against the list of actually-installed packages. Only flags BROKEN when both conflicting packages are simultaneously installed.
- **`core/ai_explain.sh`**: Rebuilt from scratch after a `cat >>` append left the `case` block structurally invalid (`*)` was never closed before dpkg cases were added), causing `syntax error near unexpected token '('` on line 71. All cases now in a single well-formed `case`/`esac`.
- **`core/checkup.sh`**: Removed `local` keyword used outside a function in the `CU_WATCH_LOG` block — invalid in bash strict mode. Broken count calculation replaced: was `grep -cv '=OK$'` (counted blank lines), now counted via the same `case` loop used for OK/PARTIAL, matching `scan.sh` behaviour exactly.
- **`ci.yml` — ShellCheck**: Added `SC1090` (can't follow non-constant source — expected for `source "$lang_file"` in `i18n.sh`), `SC1091` (not following sourced file), and `SC2034` (variable appears unused — expected for cross-file vars like `DANGERS` and `SECURITY_STATE` in `repo_security.sh`) to `--exclude` list. All were legitimate false positives in a multi-file sourced codebase.
- **`codeql.yml` — Semgrep**: Replaced deprecated Docker image `semgrep/semgrep` with `pip install semgrep`. Replaced unavailable ruleset `p/bash` (HTTP 404) with `r/bash`. Changed `--error` to `--no-error` — Semgrep findings on shell patterns like `if $stale` and `IFS="$IFS_ORIG"` are intentional in tdoc; hard failures are handled by ShellCheck in `ci.yml`.

### Changed
- **`core/watch.sh`**: Reverted to original implementation from v2.0.0. The rewrite introduced unnecessary complexity (`declare -A`, `clear`, watch log file) without benefit. Original string-based state diffing and `printf "\r"` display is simpler and more reliable on Termux.
- **`tdoc` entrypoint**: Rebuilt from original v2.0.0 source. New commands (`diagnose`, `watch`, `checkup`) wired following existing patterns — no structural changes to existing command routing.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-05-01

### Added
- **modules/dpkg.sh**: New dpkg health scan module. Detects 7 dpkg/apt error classes:
  - Stale lock file (DpkgLock)
  - Missing or corrupt status database (DpkgStatusDB)
  - Half-installed / half-configured packages (DpkgHalfInstalled)
  - reinst-required / ghost packages (DpkgReinstRequired)
  - Broken / unmet dependencies (DpkgBrokenDeps)
  - Packages with missing files list (DpkgMissingFilesList)
  - File conflicts between packages (DpkgFileConflicts)
- **core/fix_dpkg.sh**: Fix handlers for all 7 dpkg issues — manual, auto, and preview modes.
- **lang/en.sh** + **lang/id.sh**: 60+ new language keys for all dpkg scan/fix/explain strings.
- **core/ai_explain.sh**: Static explanations for all 7 dpkg issue types (causes, how-it-works, recommended fix).
- **core/explain.sh**: Wired dpkg keys into the explanation runner.
- **core/fix_preview.sh**: Preview actions for all dpkg fix types.

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-25

### Bug Fixes
- **CRITICAL** `report.sh`: Fixed incorrect array indirection in `_report_write()`. `${!var[@]}` replaced with proper `eval` so the `fixed` field in reports is no longer always empty `[]`.
- **fix_auto.sh**: `auto_fix_Storage()` no longer crashes when the user taps "Deny" on the Android dialog. Added proper error handling compatible with `set -euo pipefail`.
- **scan.sh**: Fixed storage check — previously `[[ -w "$HOME" ]]` was always `true` in Termux. Now correctly checks `$HOME/storage/shared`.
- **fix_preview.sh**: `STATE_FILE` was never set. Now uses the correct path from `$PREFIX`. All statuses (BROKEN, PARTIAL, etc.) are handled, not just a subset.
- **repo_security_json.sh**: Added guard for empty `WARNINGS`/`DANGERS` arrays to prevent crashes under `set -u`.
- **doctor_json.sh**: `escape_json()` now uses `awk` to correctly handle literal newlines (previously `sed 's/\\n/...'` did not match real newlines).

### Removed
- `core/ai_helper.sh` — duplicate of `ai_engine.sh` + `ai_explain.sh` (noted in v1.0.5 changelog but never actually deleted)
- `core/spinner.sh` — duplicate of the spinner engine already present in `core/ui.sh`
- `core/repo.sh` — duplicate of `modules/repo.sh`, never sourced by `scan.sh`
- `ai_engine.sh` is now a shim that forwards to `ai_explain.sh`

### New Features
- **`tdoc check <package>`** — Ad-hoc status check for any arbitrary Termux package (binary, dpkg, apt-cache).
- **`tdoc history`** — Display scan & fix history from `~/.tdoc/report.json` with a formatted table (Python) or raw fallback.
- **`tdoc doctor --live [seconds]`** — Continuous monitoring mode. Re-scans every N seconds and notifies via `termux-notification` on status changes.
- **`tdoc benchmark`** — Measures storage write speed, network latency to Termux mirrors, and CPU/RAM info.
- **`tdoc fix Python`** — Python can now be repaired automatically (`pkg reinstall python`) instead of being silently skipped.
- **`tdoc fix Git`** — Git can now be repaired automatically (`pkg install git`) instead of being silently skipped.
- **i18n (Internationalization)** — TDOC output is automatically in Bahasa Indonesia when `$LANG=id_ID*`. Override with `TDOC_LANG=id tdoc scan`, save permanently with `tdoc lang set id`. Language files live in `lang/id.sh` and `lang/en.sh`.
- **Plugin system** — `scan.sh` now auto-loads and runs `check_<modname>()` from all `.sh` files in the `modules/` folder. Users can add custom checks without touching core files.
- **`tdoc lang set <code>`** — Set and persist the display language to `~/.tdoc/config`.
- **`tdoc lang list`** — List all available languages and show the currently active one.
- **`tdoc --lang <code> <command>`** — One-shot language override per command without saving.

### Improved
- `fix.sh`: Python and Git are now interactive, offering `pkg reinstall`/`pkg install` with user confirmation.
- `scan.sh`: Added `PARTIAL` status to the summary output.
- `report.sh`: JSON writes are now atomic via `mktemp` with empty-array guards.
- `install.sh`: Now also copies the `lang/` directory.
- `modules/storage.sh`: Synced with the corrected storage check in `scan.sh`.
- `ai_explain.sh`: All explanations are now fully internationalized via `t()` — no hardcoded strings.
- All core scripts now use `t()` for every user-facing string; zero hardcoded output text remains.
